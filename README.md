Axis: The axis attribute specifies the direction in which the views are arranged within the stack view. You can choose between a horizontal or vertical axis. For a horizontal axis, views are arranged side by side, while for a vertical axis, views are stacked one on top of the other.

Alignment: The alignment attribute specifies how the views are aligned within the stack view. You can choose between leading, trailing, center, top, bottom, or fill alignment. Leading and trailing alignment are used for horizontal axis, while top and bottom alignment are used for vertical axis. Center alignment centers the views along the axis, while fill alignment stretches the views to fill the available space.

Spacing: The spacing attribute specifies the amount of spacing between the views within the stack view. You can set a fixed spacing value or use the default spacing value. The default spacing value is based on the layout metrics of the views in the stack view.

Distribution: The distribution attribute specifies how the views are distributed within the stack view along the axis. You can choose between fill, fillEqually, fillProportionally, equalSpacing, and equalCentering distribution. Fill distribution stretches the views to fill the available space, fillEqually distribution divides the available space equally among the views, fillProportionally distribution divides the available space among the views based on their intrinsic content size, equalSpacing distribution distributes the views with equal spacing between them, and equalCentering distribution centers the views with equal spacing between them.
